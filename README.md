> *Exploring the intersection of Industrial Engineering and Computer Technology in designing the warehouses of the future.*

## 🧠 Overview

This repository explores the **theoretical framework**, **methodologies**, and **computational models** behind the design of **automated warehouse layouts** — a critical challenge where **industrial engineering principles** meet **intelligent automation systems**.

As warehouses evolve into **autonomous, data-driven environments**, layout design must adapt to the constraints and opportunities offered by **AGVs**, **AS/RS**, **AI**, and **IoT**. This project aims to formalize those design considerations using proven theories and emerging tools.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📐 Formalize the **automated layout design problem (ALDP)**
- 🤖 Explore how **automation technologies** shape spatial design
- 🧮 Bridge classical layout theory with **modern computational tools**
- 🧠 Develop groundwork for **AI-based layout generation and simulation**
- 🔄 Enable future integration with **digital twin platforms**

## 📘 Theoretical Background

### 1. Facility Layout Problem (FLP)

A well-known NP-hard problem concerned with placing functional areas in a facility to:

- Minimize **material handling cost**  
- Optimize **flow distances** and **adjacency preferences**  
- Subject to spatial and operational constraints

**Common Approaches**:
- 🔢 Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)
- 📊 Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
- 🧬 Genetic Algorithms & Metaheuristics

---

### 2. Systematic Layout Planning (SLP)

A qualitative, heuristic framework originally developed by **Richard Muther**. Still widely used in early design stages for:

- Identifying **activity relationships**
- Defining **space requirements**
- Mapping **material flows**
- Evaluating **layout alternatives**

Though not computational, it provides a solid **human-centered starting point**.

### 3. Automation-Driven Layout Theory

As automation is introduced, layout constraints and design priorities shift:

| Automation Element | Layout Impact |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **AGVs/AMRs** | Require wide aisles, dynamic routing |
| **AS/RS** | Introduce vertical design, zoning |
| **Robotic Picking** | Demands ergonomic item placement |
| **IoT & WMS/WCS** | Enables real-time, adaptive layout logic |
| **Digital Twin** | Requires 1:1 simulation-ready spatial model |

Automation systems transform **space into programmable infrastructure**.
